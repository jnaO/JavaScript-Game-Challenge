JavaScript Game Challenge
=========================

Description
-----------

A small game of turning tiles.

All tiles have two colors, white and semi-transparent/black, laid out in a square grid. When you click
one tile in the grid the clicked tile, as well as the tile directly above, beneath and to either side 
of the tile clicked will change color.

Turn all tiles of the grid from grey to blue to complete the game.
